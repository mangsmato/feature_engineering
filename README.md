<h3>Feature Engineering with Python</h3>
<br>
<b>Problem Statement</b><br>
Sendy has hired you to help predict the estimated time of delivery of orders, from the
point of driver pickup to the point of arrival at the final destination. Build a model that
predicts an accurate delivery time, from picking up a package arriving at the final
destination. An accurate arrival time prediction will help all business to improve their
logistics and communicate the accurate time their time to their customers. You will be
required to perform various feature engineering techniques while preparing your data for
further analysis.
<br>
<b> Solution</b><br>
The project will be a success when we are able to create a regression model RMSE that is less than 10% of the target mean
